# About Me
Identifying as a “jack of all trades”, I have professional experience in a variety of positions such as event management/planning, production dramaturgy, scenic design/construction/painting, lighting design for productions, professional writing, adjunct teaching, and more. My deep commitment to interdisciplinary study is a reflection of my lifelong inability to pick a lane, a feature in which I take a lot of pride. In my spare time I enjoy a similarly stratified collection of hobbies and pass-times, including but not limited to watching movies, crocheting, baking and cooking, playing video games, crafting with very loose structure, and reading.
